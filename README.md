## How it works

A tiny hook posts a webhook every time your agent starts a session, edits a
file, runs tests, or needs your input — the same dependency-free script plugs
into both Claude Code's hooks and OpenAI Codex's lifecycle hooks. The server
keeps a live board of every session — color-coded
`idle / planning / coding / testing / blocked / done` — and streams changes to
the web dashboard and the iOS app over Server-Sent Events. When an agent
transitions into `blocked`, the server pushes a notification to your phone,
so you step away from the keyboard without losing the thread.

## Get started in 60 seconds

1. **Get the board on your phone** — the AgStatus iOS app (App Store
   submission in progress; until it's live, open `ios/AgStatus.xcodeproj` in
   Xcode and run it — a simulator build needs no signing). No iPhone? Your
   board URL works in any browser.
2. **Wire up your machine** — macOS and Linux:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://agstatus.online/install.sh | sh
   ```

   Windows (PowerShell 5.1 or newer):

   ```powershell
   irm https://agstatus.online/install.ps1 | iex
   ```

   One command: unpacks the CLI under `~/.agstatus` (no `sudo`, nothing
   system-wide), creates a private board on the hosted instance, installs a
   dependency-free Node hook, registers it in `~/.claude/settings.json` (with
   a backup) — and in `~/.codex/hooks.json` when Codex is detected — then
   prints your board URL plus a QR code to open it on your phone. (Codex asks
   you to trust the hook: run `/hooks` inside Codex — and again after an
   upgrade that changes the hook command, or Codex silently stops firing it.)
   Re-run the same command to upgrade. On macOS it also sets up
   [Focus](docs/design/focus-protocol.md) — it prints exactly what that sends,
   and `--no-focus` skips it.

   Claude Code-only machines can skip the CLI entirely and use the
   [plugin](docs/hooks.md#claude-code-plugin): `/plugin marketplace add
   KardanovIR/agstatus`, `/plugin install agstatus@agstatus`,
   `/agstatus:setup`.

3. **Start a Claude Code session** — a card appears on the board and follows
   the agent through `planning → coding → testing → done` as it works, landing
   on `done` each time it hands back to you.

Created the board in the app first? Pair your machine to it with a code:
`curl -fsSL https://agstatus.online/install.sh | sh -s -- --code XXXX-XXXX`.
Details in [docs/hooks.md](docs/hooks.md).

## Features

- **Claude Code + OpenAI Codex** — one hook script speaks both tools'
  hook systems; sessions from both land on the same board.
- **Live board** — SSE-streamed updates, no polling, no refresh.
- **No accounts** — a board is a capability URL with an unguessable token,
  like a Slack webhook. The server stores only a hash of it.
- **Push when blocked** — APNs notification the moment an agent needs you;
  opt-in per device for `done` too.
- **QR pairing** — the CLI prints a QR to open your board on the phone; the
  app hands out short-lived codes to pair more machines.
- **Plan-limit bars** — one block per agent, up to three across: the session
  and weekly windows for Claude and for Codex, including per-model caps, each
  with the time until it resets. Read locally; only percentages are sent.
- **Where the tokens went** — tap a limit block for thirty days of spend:
  tokens per day as bars, the plan limits drawn over them as lines, and a
  ranked breakdown per project. Cards carry their own session's total.
- **Session history** — in the app, every status change and command for a
  session, timestamped.
- **Streaks** — a day counter with a wood → platinum ladder, so a long run of
  active days is visible. iOS only for now.
- **Demo mode** — try the iOS app with fake sessions, no server, no data sent.
- **Privacy switch** — `--minimal` sends tool names only, never command text,
  and names cards after their folder, never a Claude session's title (which
  is generated from your prompts).
- **Focus (opt-in)** — tap a session on the board to bring its terminal to
  the front on the machine running it; see
  [docs/design/focus-protocol.md](docs/design/focus-protocol.md).
- **Focus keys** — `agstatus focus <n>` brings the n-th session's window
  forward, so a hotkey (or a macro pad's n-th button) does it without reaching
  for the phone. `agstatus keys` prints the config for skhd or Karabiner; see
  [docs/focus-keys.md](docs/focus-keys.md).
- **Self-hostable** — one Node process, optional PostgreSQL persistence, Docker image,
  bundled TLS proxy. Single-user and multi-tenant modes.
- **MIT licensed** — server, dashboard, CLI, and apps.

## Self-hosting

[![The AgStatus web board: plan-limit blocks for Claude and Codex, above five session cards across planning, testing, done, coding and blocked — each with its state icon, agent, machine, age and token count](docs/dashboard.webp)](docs/self-hosting.md)

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 ghcr.io/kardanovir/agstatus
```

(The image is published from tagged releases; until the first one lands, clone
the repo and `docker compose up -d --build`.) Persistence, TLS via the bundled
Caddy profile, multi-tenant mode, push-notification setup, and the full
environment-variable reference are in **[docs/self-hosting.md](docs/self-hosting.md)**.

### Other ways in

The [Claude Code plugin](docs/hooks.md#claude-code-plugin) is a separate,
fully supported channel — no installer, no terminal, Claude Code only.

AgStatus used to ship through npm and a Homebrew tap; neither gets new
releases now, and [the tap](https://github.com/KardanovIR/homebrew-tap) is
archived. Nothing was unpublished, though: `agstatus@1.3.0` stays resolvable on
the npm registry and the archived formula still resolves to it, so an
`npx agstatus init` or a `brew install kardanovir/tap/agstatus` in an old
script or somebody's notes still runs and still works — it just installs 1.3.0
instead of the current release. Re-run the installer to move a machine onto
current.
