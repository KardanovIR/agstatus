//  The board's design tokens, ported from public/tokens.css. The reasoning
//  lives in .impeccable.md at the repo root; the short version is here, because
//  the *why* is what stops a palette drifting back into defaults.
//
//  WHY THESE VALUES. They are authored in OKLCH on the web, where lightness is
//  perceptually uniform and a tint can be derived from a base rather than typed
//  by hand. SwiftUI has no OKLCH, so each one is converted to sRGB once, here,
//  and the OKLCH original is written beside it: that is the source of truth, and
//  a change on either platform has to start from it.
//
//  WHY GREEN. An earlier pass was warm — amber accent, warm-tinted neutrals —
//  on the argument that aviation instruments are lit warm at night to protect
//  dark adaptation. The owner rejected it: amber IS the caution convention, and
//  the accent also coloured the most common state, so the board spent all day
//  implying a warning. Every neutral is now tinted toward hue 155 at chroma
//  under 0.012 — imperceptible as colour, but it stops the ground reading as
//  the cold blue-black of every other agent dashboard.
