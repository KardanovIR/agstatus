/*
 * AgStatus — the marks.
 *
 * One definition, two pages. The board (public/app.js) and the landing page
 * (public/landing.html) both draw session cards, and the landing page used to
 * draw its own: its own card, its own badge, its own tints, no icons at all.
 * It had already drifted a whole design system behind. Anything both pages
 * render lives in one file now — the card's CSS in card.css, its marks here.
 *
 * Attached to `window` rather than exported, because both consumers are plain
 * classic scripts and a module would mean changing how the board loads.

  //
  // Inline SVG on a 16-unit grid, sized by CSS and drawn in `currentColor`, so
  // a status mark inherits --state from its own card and costs no request.
  //
  // Shape first, colour second: peripheral vision resolves form long before hue,
  // and roughly one man in twelve cannot separate the red and green states by
  // colour at all. The board's second design principle — state is never carried
  // by hue alone — had no second channel on the web before these.
  //
  // These are the same six marks iOS draws with SF Symbols. Theme.symbol's
  // comment has said they "mirror the web board's icons exactly" since 1.5,
  // which was false the whole time: the web board had no icons to mirror.
  //
  // The agent marks are deliberately NOT the Anthropic or OpenAI logos. This
  // board is self-hosted by other people, and redistributing someone's
  // trademark inside it is a different thing from naming their tool.
