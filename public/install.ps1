# AgStatus installer for Windows.
#
#   irm https://agstatus.online/install.ps1 | iex
#
# `irm | iex` cannot take parameters: the pipe hands Invoke-Expression a string,
# and there is nowhere to hang `-Code` off. The conventional idiom is to compile
# the downloaded text into a script block and call *that* with arguments:
#
#   & ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://agstatus.online/install.ps1))) -Code XXXX-XXXX
#
# Both forms work here because the param() block below is the first statement in
# the file, so Invoke-Expression and [scriptblock]::Create() bind to the same
# parameters; piped with no arguments they simply come through empty.
#
# param() below is a *simple* parameter block, so anything PowerShell cannot
# bind to one of those four parameters is dropped into $args rather than
# refused. Step 0 of the installer rejects whatever ends up there, because the
# alternative is installing happily with a mistyped flag silently ignored.
#
# Shape of this file, and why:
#   - everything that *does* something lives in Invoke-AgStatusInstall, which is
#     called on the very last line. A truncated download either fails to parse
#     (unbalanced braces - nothing runs) or stops before that last line (only
#     definitions exist - nothing runs). A half-installed tree is the one outcome
#     this shape rules out.
#   - the helpers above it are definitions only, with no side effects, for the
#     same reason.
#   - nothing at top level assigns to a preference variable. Invoke-Expression
#     evaluates in the *caller's* scope, so a top-level
#     `$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'` would leak into the user's shell and stay
#     there. Function scope contains it.
#
# It targets Windows PowerShell 5.1 (Desktop), which is what Windows 10 and 11
# ship and what `irm | iex` lands in from a stock terminal. So: no `??`, no
# ternary `? :`, no `&&` / `||`, no `-SkipHttpErrorCheck`, no
# `ConvertFrom-Json -AsHashtable`, no three-argument `Join-Path`.
#
# The file is deliberately pure ASCII. Two separate reasons, both real:
#   - Invoke-RestMethod on 5.1 decodes a response body as ISO-8859-1 when the
#     server sends no charset in Content-Type, so a UTF-8 checkmark in a string
#     literal arrives as mojibake before the script ever runs;
#   - the legacy console host renders at codepage 437/1252, so even a correctly
#     decoded checkmark prints as garbage.
# Hence [ok] / [!] / -> instead of the glyphs used elsewhere in this repo.
#
# What it installs (the layout contract, identical to the POSIX installer except
# for the prefix):
#   %LOCALAPPDATA%\AgStatus\bin\agstatus.cmd          the launcher shim
#   %LOCALAPPDATA%\AgStatus\lib\agstatus\dist\cli.js  the CLI entry point
#   %LOCALAPPDATA%\AgStatus\lib\agstatus\assets\      the hook
#   %LOCALAPPDATA%\AgStatus\lib\node_modules\         the one runtime dependency
#   %LOCALAPPDATA%\AgStatus\LICENSE                   the MIT licence it ships under
#
# That prefix is the same directory the hook already uses for its Windows state
# (cli/src/listener/config.ts defaultStateDir, docs/design/focus-protocol.md
# 3.1: machine.json, sessions/). Upgrades therefore replace bin\ and lib\ and
# must leave everything else under the prefix alone.

function Get-AgStatusLatestVersion {
    <#
      Resolve the newest release from the 302 that
      /releases/latest serves, rather than from api.github.com/releases/latest.
      The HTML endpoint is a plain unauthenticated redirect with no rate limit
      worth the name; the API endpoint is 60 requests/hour/IP, which a shared
      office NAT or a CI runner burns through without trying.

      Why [Net.HttpWebRequest] and not `Invoke-WebRequest -MaximumRedirection 0`:
      the two PowerShell generations disagree about what a suppressed redirect
      means. Windows PowerShell 5.1 treats the 302 as a terminating error, so the
      Location header has to be dug out of the thrown WebException's .Response.
      PowerShell 7 returns the 302 as an ordinary response object and throws
      nothing. Code covering both ends up with a try/catch whose *success* path is
      the catch block on one host and the try block on the other - easy to get
      subtly wrong, and impossible to test here. HttpWebRequest with
      AllowAutoRedirect = $false behaves the same on both: only >= 400 raises a
      WebException, a 3xx just comes back, and we always read .Headers['Location'].

      The redirect is read rather than followed - AllowAutoRedirect = $true would
      chase whatever chain it was handed and download the release page at the
      end just to report where it stopped - with one exception: a renamed or
      transferred repository. Its old /releases/latest answers with a 301 to the
      new one's /releases/latest, and only that one names the tag. So a Location
      that is itself https://github.com/<owner>/<name>/releases/latest
      (Test-AgStatusLatestUrl) is asked again, at most three times; anything else
      is the answer. When this repo was renamed from claude-status-dashboard to
      agstatus, this function read that 301 as the answer and refused every
      install until $repo caught up. install.sh's resolve_version follows the
      same rule. The downloads need no such care: Invoke-WebRequest follows a
      rename's redirect on its own.

      expand" a real boundary rather than a slogan: enumerate the entries,

      Put <prefix>\bin on the persistent user PATH. Returns 'added' when it
      changed something, 'present' when the entry was already there, and
      'too-long' when the PATH cannot take another entry (see trap (iv)).

      Trap (i) - the destructive one. [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(
      'Path', $v, 'User') always writes REG_SZ. A user PATH is normally
      REG_EXPAND_SZ and routinely holds entries like %USERPROFILE%\.local\bin or
      %JAVA_HOME%\bin; rewriting it as REG_SZ freezes those to whatever they
      happened to expand to today, and they stop tracking the variable forever
      after. Worse, the matching *read*, [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable(
      'Path', 'User'), hands back the expanded string, so the naive
      read-append-write loses the %VAR% entries even before the type changes.
      The fix is to go at the registry directly: read the raw value with
      RegistryValueOptions.DoNotExpandEnvironmentNames, and write it back with
      the RegistryValueKind it already had.

      Trap (ii) - re-running the installer must not append a second copy. Compare
      *expanded*, quote-stripped, trailing-backslash-trimmed entries, since our
      target is a literal path and an existing entry may be a %VAR% form of it.
      PowerShell's -eq on strings is case-insensitive, which is what we want on a
      case-insensitive filesystem.

      Trap (iv) - the legacy length limits. setx and a number of older installers
      truncate a PATH past 2047 characters, silently. We cannot fix someone
      else's PATH, but we can warn before we are blamed for it, and near the
      registry string ceiling we leave the PATH alone rather than write a value
      Windows will reject or clip.

      That last case returns 'too-long'; it deliberately does not throw. By the
      time this function is called, lib\ and bin\ are already on disk and
      `agstatus init` has not run yet, so throwing painted a red failure over an
      install that had in fact landed - and skipped the pairing step, which is
      the part the user actually came for. A PATH we cannot extend is a warning
      plus the manual fix, printed here where the length is known.

      Trap (iii) is handled by the caller, which also has to fix up $env:Path.
