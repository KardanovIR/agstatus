# AgStatus installer — the one documented way in on macOS and Linux:
#
#   curl -fsSL https://agstatus.online/install.sh | sh
#   curl -fsSL https://agstatus.online/install.sh | sh -s -- --code ABCD-1234
#   curl -fsSL https://agstatus.online/install.sh | AGSTATUS_VERSION=1.3.0 sh
#
# It downloads the release artifact for the current version from GitHub,
# verifies it against that release's SHA256SUMS, unpacks it under
# ${AGSTATUS_HOME:-$HOME/.agstatus}, renders the launcher shim, puts it on
# PATH and then runs `agstatus init`. On macOS it also installs the Focus
# listener (docs/design/focus-protocol.md §5.4) unless --no-focus: it prints
# what Focus puts on the wire (§8) rather than asking, because a script on the
# end of a pipe has no stdin to ask with.
#
# Rules this file lives by:
#
#   * POSIX sh, because `| sh` is dash on Debian/Ubuntu and busybox ash on
#     Alpine: no bashisms, no arrays, and no `local` (ksh93 does not have it).
#   * Every statement lives in a function and `main "$@"` is the last line, so
#     a truncated download can never run half an installer — a copy cut off
#     mid-transfer simply never reaches the call.
#   * It never reads stdin: through a pipe stdin *is* this script. Every choice
#     is a flag, never a question.
#   * Nothing is extracted before its checksum matches, and nothing is written
#     outside the prefix except the one guarded PATH block in a shell profile.

AgStatus installer — live status board for your coding agents.

  curl -fsSL https://agstatus.online/install.sh | sh
  curl -fsSL https://agstatus.online/install.sh | sh -s -- [options]

Options (everything but --focus/--no-focus is passed to `agstatus init`):
  --code XXXX-XXXX  Pair with a board created elsewhere (e.g. the mobile app)
  --url <base>      Server to use (for a self-hosted board)
  --secret <s>      Webhook secret for self-hosted single-tenant servers
  --minimal         Send tool and folder names, never command text, prompts
                    or session titles
  --no-qr           Skip the QR code
  --codex           Also set up OpenAI Codex even if ~/.codex isn't detected
  --no-codex        Skip Codex setup (default: auto-configure when detected)
  --no-focus        Don't install the macOS Focus listener (it installs by default)
  --focus           Install it even after an earlier --no-focus (last flag wins)
  --help            This text

Environment:
  AGSTATUS_HOME     Install prefix (default: $HOME/.agstatus)
  AGSTATUS_VERSION  Version to install (default: the latest release)
  AGSTATUS_NODE     Absolute path to the node binary to use
USAGE
}

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# node resolution — emitted once, used twice
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The installer sources this to find a node for itself, and the launcher shim
# embeds the very same text, so the two can never drift apart. The shim has to
# carry its own copy: it runs months later, under launchd, with no installer
# anywhere near it.
#
# Why the shim exists at all: launchd resolves a job's ProgramArguments[0]
# against launchd's own default PATH (/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin) and never
# against the job's EnvironmentVariables.PATH — a bare program name found only
# there exits 78 (EX_CONFIG) without ever running. nvm/fnm/volta put node in
# none of those four directories, so ProgramArguments[0] must be an absolute
# path we own and node must be resolved at launch rather than baked in: the
# user upgrades node, and a baked path is gone.
#
# `newest` reverses its arguments so a glob (which sorts ascending) is walked
# newest-first, and takes the first candidate that is executable and reports a
# major >= 18 — which is why a stray v3.1.0, lexically last, never wins.
