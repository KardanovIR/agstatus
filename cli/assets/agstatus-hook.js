/**
 * AgStatus hook for Claude Code and OpenAI Codex (dependency-free, node >= 18).
 *
 * Posts session status to an AgStatus dashboard. Both tools deliver the hook
 * payload as JSON on stdin with the same core fields (hook_event_name,
 * session_id, cwd). Wired to SessionStart, PreToolUse, Stop, and
 * UserPromptSubmit + Notification + SessionEnd (Claude Code) /
 * PermissionRequest (Codex).
 *
 * IMPORTANT: this script must never write to stdout — Codex interprets hook
 * stdout as behavior-control JSON, and a stray print could block a tool call.
 *
 * Configuration comes from three places, in this order: the environment, then
 * `agstatus-hook.json` beside this script (the sidecar `agstatus init` writes
 * for Codex, because an env-var prefix on a command line is a POSIX shell
 * construct that does not exist on Windows), then ~/.agstatus.json — written
 * by the Claude Code plugin's /agstatus:setup, which cannot set env vars.
 * Sidecar keys are the env names lowercased and unprefixed: url, secret,
 * detail, source. `source` is the one key never taken from ~/.agstatus.json:
 * that file is shared by both agents on a machine.
 *
 * Env:
 *   CLAUDE_STATUS_URL     (board URL; "url" in either config file, and the
 *                          hook exits silently when none of the three is set)
 *   CLAUDE_STATUS_SECRET  (optional; sent as x-webhook-secret, legacy servers;
 *                          "secret" in either config file)
 *   AGSTATUS_DETAIL=off   (optional; send tool names instead of command text,
 *                          and folder names instead of session titles;
 *                          "detail": "off" in either config file)
 *   AGSTATUS_USAGE=off    (optional; never report plan-usage percentages, and
 *                          never scan local logs for per-project or
 *                          per-session token spend)
 *   AGSTATUS_PROJECT_FORCE=1 (optional; skip the local-log scan's throttle)
 *   AGSTATUS_SOURCE       (optional; agent kind tag, defaults to "claude" —
 *                          the Codex sidecar sets "source": "codex")
 *   AGSTATUS_FOCUS=off    (optional; ignore "focus": true in ~/.agstatus.json —
 *                          no host summary on the wire, no local session record)
 *   AGSTATUS_STATE_DIR    (optional; where machine.json and the session records
 *                          live, instead of the per-platform app-state dir)
 *
 * Besides session status, the hook reports plan usage so the dashboard can
 * show limit bars, from whichever source the running agent has:
 *   - Claude: reads the Claude Code OAuth token locally and asks Anthropic's
 *     usage endpoint for utilization percentages. Only those percentages and
 *     reset times ever reach the AgStatus server — never the token itself.
 *   - Codex: reads the rate_limits block Codex already writes into its own
 *     session rollout log. Entirely local — no credentials, no network call.
 * Throttled to one attempt per 5 minutes per (board, source), and only on
 * quiet events (never PreToolUse).
 *
 * With "focus": true in ~/.agstatus.json (written only by `agstatus listener
 * install`, which also creates machine.json in the per-machine state dir) the
 * hook adds a `host` summary to every status post — a label for this machine,
 * an id specific to this machine and board, and the hosting app's slug, name
 * and kind — so a tap on the board can bring the session's window to the
 * front. Everything the listener needs to do that (pid, tty, cwd, terminal
 * ids, socket paths) stays in a local 0600 record and never goes on the wire.
 * "focus": false sends `host: null` so a live card clears its labels.
 *   machine key = sha256(machineId + "\n" + base) as 64 hex chars, and
 *   machine.id = sha256(key).slice(0, 32) — where machineId is the raw uuid
 *   in machine.json and base is the board URL as boardBase() normalizes it
 *   (no trailing "/", no "/webhook"). Only the id goes on the wire; the key
 *   is the listener's credential (it proves it is this machine when it
 *   subscribes, claims and acks), so a viewer who sees the id cannot pose
 *   as the machine. The raw id never leaves the machine.
 * First-time host detection is bounded as a whole (HOST_DETECT_DEADLINE_MS):
 * when it runs over, the post goes out without `host` (the server carries the
 * previous value forward) and the next event fills it in.
 *
 * Never blocks Claude Code: always exits 0, prints nothing, hard 3s HTTP
 * timeout, and an overall ~4s safety timeout.

 * <home>/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-<timestamp>-<id>.jsonl, and that <id> is

 * sometimes and usually do not: of the 226 rollouts on the machine this was
 * diagnosed on, 181 had a filename id that differed from their own
 * session_meta.session_id. This function used to match the payload's
 * session_id against the filename and therefore found `own` about one time in
 * five; the rest of the time it silently fell through to the sibling list and
 * got the right answer anyway, because the newest sibling usually IS the
 * session's own log. That accident is fine for account-wide rate limits and
 * useless for anything that has to be about THIS session.
 *
 * Siblings matter even when the session's own log is found: Codex writes its

 * `--backfill` (offsets reset, every log read from zero) lands on exactly the
 * number an unbroken series of incremental runs would have reached.
 *
 * That holds for a log that only ever APPENDS, which is the normal case and the
 * one the tests cover. A log that SHRINKS — truncated, rotated, replaced in
 * place — has no offset that means anything any more, and readNewLines skips to
 * the new end rather than replaying from zero precisely because replaying would
 * add the pre-shrink bytes to a total that already contains them. See the note
 * there; the short version is that this counter can under-report a rotated log
 * and must never over-report one.

// ---- Session names (a title, else the folder pinned at SessionStart) --------
//
// A card's name is the one thing a person navigates the board by, so it has to
// be one they recognise, and it has to hold still. Two sources, in order, and
// a placeholder for a session that has neither:
//
//   1. The session's TITLE, when the agent has one. The Claude desktop app
//      titles every session it runs ("Session organization by agent"), and
//      `/rename` titles one in the CLI; both record it in the transcript (see
//      readTranscriptTitle). This is what retires the worst names the board
//      showed: the desktop app runs sessions in worktrees it names itself, so a
//      card named after its folder read "zealous-jennings-84637b".
//   2. Otherwise the session's FOLDER, as it stood at SessionStart. The name
//      used to be recomputed on every event as path.basename(payload.cwd),
//      which let a session rename its own card the moment the agent changed
//      directory — one live session read "backend" and later "docs"; another
//      read "claude-status" while its transcript sat under a different project
//      entirely. So the folder a session starts in is the one it keeps —
//      through a `cd`, and through the SessionStart `/compact` fires halfway
//      down a session.
//   3. With neither — an agent the OS started at `/`, or one whose folder is a
//      bare UUID — the agent's own name, "Claude" or "Codex" (agentLabel), and
//      never pinned, so the first event that knows a real folder can still
//      claim the card (see pinnedName).
//
// The two are allowed to move differently, on purpose. The folder never moves,
// because what it defends against — a `cd` — is incidental to the work. A title
// moves when someone renames the session, because a rename is deliberate: it is
// a person telling the board what this card is called. What a title must not do
// is flicker. The hook reads only the end of the transcript, and an event that
// follows a pasted image or a large tool output can miss the title record
// entirely (about one gap in ten between copies is wider than the window; see
// TITLE_TAIL_BYTES); a title once seen is therefore pinned in the same entry
// as the folder, and holds until the transcript shows a different one.
//
// Titles are only for Claude Code with detail on (TITLES): a Codex transcript
// is a rollout of another schema, and minimal mode withholds titles because
// they are generated from the prompts it already withholds. The folder is kept
// BESIDE a pinned title, not overwritten by it, so turning minimal mode on
// mid-session drops a card back to the folder it started in rather than to
// whichever folder the session happens to be standing in.
//
// The pin has to survive between hook runs (every event is its own process)
// and it has to work with Focus OFF, which rules out the session records under
// the Focus state dir: that directory exists only for a machine that opted in,
// and host.test.ts pins the promise that the hook writes nothing there
// otherwise. So this follows the per-project usage state instead (see
// projectStateFile): one small JSON file in the system temp dir, keyed by
// board and source, replaced whole through temp + rename, and read as empty
// whenever it cannot be trusted. Losing the file costs a name carried over
// from an earlier event — never an event, and never a throw. It is written
// 0600: a title is the user's own words, and on Linux the temp dir is shared.

  // mid-turn nor an event whose transcript read missed the title can rename a
  // live card. `project` is the session's LOCATION, and stays live on purpose:
  //   - it is the only thing left on the wire that says where the agent is
  //     working right now, and a status post is otherwise all "now" (status,
  //     message and host all describe this instant);
  //   - it lines up with the per-project USAGE totals, which are keyed by the
  //     folder each log record was written in — /usage/projects aggregates
  //     spend per folder per day across sessions, and a session that moves
  //     really does spend tokens in both, so that scan keeps reading the cwd
  //     out of each record (scanClaudeLogs / scanCodexLogs), untouched here —
  //     with the one exception below;
  //   - all three boards print `project` beside the name whenever the two
  //     differ (SessionCardView.swift, public/app.js cardMeta, SessionCard.kt).
  //     With folder names that meant "this session moved"; with titles the two
  //     differ on almost every card, so it reads as where a titled session is
  //     working (a card titled "Fix the login bug" adds "in backend"). A
  //     folder-named session shows it once it has moved — and also from its
  //     very first event when it stands at a worktree root, where (below) the
  //     name is the worktree folder and the project the repo, so the card reads
  //     "feature-x · in claude-status" without the session ever having moved.
  //     Any other folder-named session that never left home shows nothing extra.
  //
  // The exception: a cwd that IS a Claude worktree root,
  // <repo>/.claude/worktrees/<name>, reports <repo> (worktreeRepoName). That
  // folder's name is one the desktop app made up, and printed under a title it
  // would put "in zealous-jennings-84637b" straight back on the card the title
  // just took it off. A directory INSIDE a worktree keeps its own basename,
  // exactly as a session that cd'd into a subdirectory of a normal checkout
  // does. `name` does not follow: its folder fallback stays the worktree's own
  // (see pinnedName). Nor do the usage scans, which still file a worktree's
  // tokens under the worktree folder — that join is a change to those scans,
  // not to this line.
