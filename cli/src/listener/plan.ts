/**
 * The Focus planner: the decision ladder of design §5.2 as a pure function
 * from (record, command, machine facts) to the argv arrays the runtime will
 * execFile — no I/O, no clock, so every row runs on CI with fixture records.
 *
 * v1 ships the prompt-free rows only (§5.4): a multiplexer's own pane
 * selection, then the outer app by bundle id — agterm, kitty, iTerm2's URL,
 * WezTerm's CLI, the Codex Desktop and Claude Desktop deep links,
 * JetBrains/Zed root-open, and `open -b` for the other apps in the table —
 * Claude Desktop's among them for a `claude` started inside one of its
 * sessions, whose own bundle is not in the table (insideDesktopAgent()).
 * Terminal.app and Ghostty degrade to the app level until the signed sender
 * of v1.1 exists.
 *
 * `resume` (§5.2 step 4) is the same ladder with one extra rung: on a live
 * session it *is* a focus (the user asked for the window, the session never
 * died), and on a dead one it is a respawn — a host row that starts exactly
 * one process, `agstatus-resume <session-uuid>`, in the directory the
 * runtime resolved. Rows that cannot start a process without AppleScript or
 * a file on disk (Terminal.app, iTerm2) say `unsupported-host` rather than
 * invent one. The two desktop apps start nothing at all: each keeps its own
 * conversations, so its deep link opens the dead one in the app and the app
 * carries it on from there.
 *
 * Trust (§5.1): argv[0] is `OPEN`, an absolute path from facts.bins, or
 * facts.launcher — never a PATH lookup, never a value from the record. Every
 * record or env value that lands in an argv or a URL has passed its regex
 * here, whatever validateRecord() did before; a bundle id reaches `open -b`
 * only when it is in the table below — the record's `app.bundle` and the
 * bundle the runtime read off a multiplexer client's process tree are both
 * refused when the table does not know them (and `app.path` is never taken
 * from the record at all, §5.1). The one record whose unknown bundle is not
 * refused is still no exception to the first half: a `claude` nested in a
 * Claude Desktop session records `com.anthropic.claude-code`, and what it gets
 * is `open -b` of the table's own CLAUDE_DESKTOP constant, never the id it
 * recorded (insideDesktopAgent()). A step's `env` carries only the one socket
 * variable its tool needs. The one *command string* a plan may contain is
 * `'<launcher>' <uuid>`: a fixed absolute path the installer wrote and a
 * token that passed UUID_RE, and nothing else, ever.

 * Every env value involved is INHERITED, which is what makes this more than a
 * regex. Claude Code fills CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT in only when it is unset, so
 * a `claude` started inside a desktop session — from its Bash tool, say —
 * reports `claude-desktop` as well, and carries the parent's host session id
 * and `__CFBundleIdentifier` along with it. Its link would open the PARENT's
 * conversation and ack `focused` for a session that conversation does not
 * show: the plausible-but-wrong window the Warp row below guards against. So
 * the entrypoint is necessary and no more than that, and the record must also
 * show, from the process tree, that it is the agent the app started:
 *
 * - `app` came from the ppid walk and is Claude.app itself. The app runs its
 *   agent out of a nested claude.app (`com.anthropic.claude-code`) and the
 *   hook's walk starts at the agent's PARENT (findBundle() in the hook), so
 *   for the agent the app spawned the first bundle above it is Claude.app,
 *   while a CLI nested in that session walks into the parent agent's
 *   claude.app first and records `com.anthropic.claude-code` — a bundle the
 *   focus table does not even know, and which this function therefore never
 *   accepts: that record gets Claude Desktop raised by insideDesktopAgent(),
 *   never a link. `via: 'env'` is the hook falling back to
 *   the inherited `__CFBundleIdentifier`, and proves nothing about who
 *   spawned whom.
 * - no tty. The app starts its agent without a terminal (`??` to ps, and no
 *   `tty` in any record the app's sessions have produced); a `claude` typed
 *   into a terminal has one — the app's own terminal panel included, whose
 *   shells run under Claude Helper inside Claude.app and so walk to exactly
 *   the same bundle.
 * - no multiplexer. The app never starts its agent inside one, and with a mux
 *   in the record the Claude Desktop row is only raising an outer client.
 *
 * If a later app version ran its agent from outside any bundle, a CLI nested
 * in its Bash tool would pass all three, and the link would open the
 * conversation whose tool call is running that CLI — still the wrong ack, but
 * the nearest thing that process has to a window, never a stranger's. Any
 * check that fails is plain activation, never a refusal: the app still comes
 * forward, which is all this row did before it knew the link.

 * CLAUDE_DESKTOP_AGENT: a bundle the table does not know, and one that must
 * never reach `open -b`. The window that process lives in is Claude Desktop's,
 * so Focus raises Claude Desktop — the constant, never the recorded id.
 *
 * The bundle id alone is not enough to say so. Nothing promises that
 * `com.anthropic.claude-code` stays Claude Desktop's private copy: a future
 * standalone Claude Code install could plausibly ship under the same id, and a
 * `claude` started under one of those from a terminal would then raise Claude
 * Desktop for a session it has nothing to do with — a plausible window, and the
 * wrong one, which is worse than none (the Warp row's argument). So the record
 * must also show it inherited a desktop session's environment:
 *
 * - `entrypoint: claude-desktop`. Claude Code fills CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT in
 *   only when it is unset, so every `claude` below a desktop session reports
 *   the session's; one started from a terminal reports `cli`.
 * - `__CFBundleIdentifier` is Claude Desktop's, when the record has one.
 *   LaunchServices sets it for the app, and the agent and its Bash tool hand
 *   it down unchanged. A record without it is let through on the entrypoint —
 *   the hook omits absent keys, and an app that stops exporting it should not
 *   start refusing taps — but a record that names some OTHER app there was
 *   launched from that app's environment, and is refused.
 * - `via: 'ppid-walk'`, and no multiplexer. The bundle came from the process
 *   tree: the hook's env fallback IS `__CFBundleIdentifier`, so a claude-code
 *   bundle learned that way would name the app that launched the process, not
 *   a bundle it lives in. With a mux the outer client decides which window
 *   comes forward, as for every other row: focusPlan() only asks this of a
 *   record without one, and the check is here so the predicate says the same
 *   on its own, to any later caller.
 *
 * Which is the reason this is plain activation and never the per-session
 * link: the two inherited values and the bundle the walk met say the process
 * lives in the app, not which conversation it belongs to, and the inherited
 * host session id names the PARENT's (desktopSessionId() refuses this record
 * on its bundle, so the resume row cannot link it either). A record that fails
