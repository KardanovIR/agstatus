# What Focus can and cannot reach

Focus is the feature where you tap a session on the board and the terminal
running that agent comes to the front on the machine it runs on.

This page is the honest version of where that works. It is written from the
listener's source, not from intentions: the supported set below is a literal
transcription of the table in `cli/src/listener/plan.ts`.

**The two sentences that answer most questions:**

1. **Focus is macOS-only.** There is no Linux or Windows listener. The
   installers on those platforms deliberately install nothing and say so.
2. **Support is a closed list, not a capability.** The listener raises apps it
   has an entry for. An app it does not recognise is refused outright rather
   than attempted — you get `unsupported-host`, not a silent failure.

## What works today

Everything here is macOS. "Exact" means the specific tab, pane or session is
selected. "App only" means the application comes forward and whatever was last
focused inside it stays focused.

### Exact

| Host | How | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **agterm** | `agtermctl window select` + `session select` | window and session |
| **Herdr** | `herdr agent focus <pane>` | pane |
| **tmux** | `select-window`, `select-pane`, `switch-client` | pane, then the outer terminal is raised |
| **Zellij** | `zellij action focus-pane-id` | pane |
| **GNU screen** | `screen -X select` | window |
| **kitty** | `kitten @ focus-window --match id:` | **only if you configured `allow_remote_control` and a `listen_on unix:` socket** — off by default |
| **iTerm2** | `iterm2:reveal?sessionid=` | session |
| **Warp** | `open warp://session/<uuid>` | window, pane group and pane — **experimental**, see below |
| **WezTerm** | `wezterm cli activate-pane` | pane |
| **Codex Desktop** | `codex://threads/<id>` | the thread |
| **Claude Desktop** | `claude://claude.ai/epitaxy/<session id>` | the session — **experimental**, see below; app only when the session cannot be proven to be the app's own, a `claude` run from a session's Bash tool included |
| **JetBrains IDEs, Zed, Android Studio** | `open -b <bundle> <project root>` | the project window |

### App only

Terminal.app · Ghostty · Alacritty · Hyper · Tabby · Rio · Xcode ·
VS Code · VS Code Insiders · Cursor · Windsurf

For these the app comes forward and that is all. The reason is the same for most
of them and is worth stating plainly: **tab-exact focus in Terminal.app and
Ghostty needs Apple Events, and the listener sends none.** A plain Node process
cannot send Apple Events without triggering a consent prompt for every app it
touches, so the mechanism waits for a signed helper app in a later release.
There is no AppleScript anywhere in the shipped listener.

## What does not work, and why

### Linux and Windows — no listener exists

Not "degraded". Absent. `agstatus listener install` refuses on any non-Darwin
platform, and the `install.sh` / `install.ps1` scripts skip the listener
entirely rather than install something inert.

`agstatus listener run` is not platform-gated and will start in the foreground
anywhere, but every plan it produces hard-codes macOS binaries (`/usr/bin/open`,
`/usr/bin/lsappinfo`), so app-raising steps fail there. Multiplexer steps
(tmux, Zellij, screen, Herdr) use portable commands and would plausibly select
the right pane while raising nothing — plausibly, because that path has not been
run on Linux and is untested.

Two things worth knowing about the eventual ports, because they are not
symmetrical problems:

- **Windows** can target a *window* (`wt -w <id>`) but not a session. Windows
  Terminal already sets a per-tab `WT_SESSION` GUID and nothing consumes it for
  focus; a request to add that was closed as not planned. `SetForegroundWindow`
  also flashes the taskbar rather than raising, for an unprivileged caller.
- **Wayland** is structurally hostile rather than merely unimplemented: a
  background daemon cannot hold a valid activation token by construction. This
  is not a gap we can close by writing more code, and it matters — Wayland is
  now the default session on mainstream desktops.

### No window exists at all

These are not failures to fix. There is genuinely nothing to raise, and the
board should say so rather than offer a button that does nothing:

- **Cloud and web agents** — Claude Code cloud sessions, Codex cloud, Cursor
  cloud agents, Jules, Codespaces and similar. The process is on someone else's
  VM.
- **Headless runs** — `claude -p`, the Agent SDK, `codex exec`. The listener
  refuses these explicitly; there is no terminal they belonged to.
- **Detached multiplexer sessions.** A detached tmux session has no attached
  client and therefore no window anywhere. It gets one again when you reattach.
- **CI runners and headless servers.**

### Remote sessions

**SSH without a multiplexer is refused** (`remote`). The agent is on another
machine; the window you want is the local terminal holding the SSH client, and
the listener does not currently follow that chain.

**SSH with tmux works**, because tmux gives a join key that survives the machine
boundary: the listener resolves the attached client's tty back to the local
terminal and then selects the pane. This is the one remote case that is properly
supported, and it is worth knowing about.

### Containers and devcontainers — undocumented

There is no container handling anywhere in this repo: no code, no tests, no
documentation. In practice an agent inside a container has no macOS bundle id in
its record and will be refused as `unsupported-host`, but that is inference from
reading the code rather than a tested behaviour, and it is not a promise.

### IDE-embedded terminals

VS Code, Cursor and Windsurf get app-level activation only, and the obstacle is
architectural rather than an oversight: **VS Code runs one shared pty host
process for every window**, so walking up the process tree from an agent lands
on a process that no window owns. Detecting VS Code is trivial; attributing a
session to a *window* needs a side channel.

The likely side channel already exists — the `~/.claude/ide/<port>.lock` files
that Claude Code's own IDE integration writes, one per running IDE. The code
comment in the bundle table already points at it. Not built.

## Things this page does not claim

The supported set above is transcribed from the listener's source and I checked
it directly. The surrounding landscape — what other terminals and agent tools
can do, and how common they are — comes from a research pass whose sources I did
not re-verify individually. Where that research reported something as
unconfirmed, it is described here as unconfirmed or left out.

Three specific opportunities it surfaced that are **not** implemented and are
recorded here only so they are not lost:

- **Ghostty 1.3+ ships an AppleScript dictionary** with a `focus` command that
  brings a specific terminal's window to the front. That would move Ghostty from
  app-only to exact — subject to the same Apple Events consent problem that
  holds up Terminal.app.
- **Warp's per-session focus URL is now implemented** — it moved to the exact
  table above. Two caveats stand. It is undocumented, absent from Warp's
  published URI scheme, so it may change without notice; that is why the row
  ships experimental and falls back to plain activation rather than refusing
  when the value is missing or malformed. And Warp exports the variable into
  the environment, so children inherit it: a session started from Warp but
  running elsewhere holds a well-formed URL naming someone else's window. What
  prevents that raising the wrong window is the dispatch, not the URL check —
  the row runs only when the session's resolved host really is Warp. Nobody
  here has a Warp install, so this is verified at the planner and **not**
  end to end.
- **Claude Desktop's per-session link is implemented** too, with the same two
  caveats in a sharper form. The link — `claude://claude.ai/epitaxy/` plus the
  `local_<uuid>` id the app hands its agent as `CLAUDE_CODE_HOST_SESSION_ID` —
  is the one the app's own session API returns as the way to open a session
  from outside the app, on a scheme its Info.plist registers; nothing public
  promises the path, so the row ships experimental and falls back to plain
  activation whenever there is no id it trusts. And here the bundle dispatch is
  *not* enough: a `claude` started inside a desktop session — from its Bash
  tool, or in the app's terminal panel — inherits the id, the bundle id and the
  `claude-desktop` entrypoint alike, and its link would open the parent's
  conversation. So the link is used only when the process tree shows the app
  spawned this agent itself (Claude.app found by the ppid walk, no tty, no
  multiplexer). What the others get depends on where their walk lands. A
  `claude` in the app's terminal panel walks to Claude.app itself and gets
  plain activation. A `claude` run from a desktop session's Bash tool walks
  into the parent agent's own bundled `claude.app` first and records *its*
  bundle id, `com.anthropic.claude-code`. That id is not in the table and is
  never handed to `open` — it would launch the agent binary as an app — but the
  window that `claude` lives in is Claude Desktop's, so Focus on it, and a
  Resume tap while it is still running, bring Claude Desktop to the front:
  plain activation, not experimental, and never the link. It gets that only
  when the record also carries the inherited `claude-desktop` entrypoint and,
  if it has one, Claude Desktop's `__CFBundleIdentifier`; the same bundle id
  with anything else answers `unsupported-host`, because nothing promises that
  a future standalone Claude Code will not ship under it, and raising Claude
  Desktop for a terminal session would be the wrong window. A Resume tap on a
  session whose agent has gone opens the same link, and the app carries the
  conversation on — nothing is started; one whose record the link cannot
  trust, a nested CLI's included, brings the app to the front instead.
  The link has been checked against the app's own API and **not** opened end
  to end.
- **Windsurf has been renamed to Devin Desktop.** The bundle id in our table
  (`com.exafunction.windsurf`) may no longer be the shipping one.

Several agent tools in common use have no entry at all: Antigravity, Kiro,
Devin Desktop, Conductor, Nimbalyst, OpenHands' desktop app and Amp among them.
Each would raise only if its bundle id were added.

## When Focus declines, what you see

The listener answers with a reason rather than failing quietly:

| Reason | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `unsupported-host` | the app is not in the table, or the record carries no bundle id |
| `remote` | an SSH session with no multiplexer |
| `not-running` | the agent's process is gone — this is what makes the board offer Resume |
| `app-not-running` | the app is in the table but is not open on that machine |
| `unsupported-type` | a headless entrypoint that was never a window |
| `no-record` / `bad-record` | nothing usable on disk for that session |
| `respawn-failed` | a Resume started something that never reported back in time |

Three further reasons — `ambiguous`, `consent-needed` and `mux-detached` — are
declared in the wire types and the boards can render them, but no code path
currently emits any of them.

A focus that runs but cannot confirm the app reached the front is reported as
`selected` rather than `focused` — macOS keeps the current app in front while
you are typing, and the listener does not pretend otherwise.
