# HTTP API reference

The server runs in one of two modes:

- **Legacy (single-tenant)** — the default. One global board; the endpoints
  under [Legacy endpoints](#legacy-single-tenant-endpoints) apply.
- **Multi-tenant** (`MULTI_TENANT=true`) — boards ("workspaces") live under
  `/w/<token>/...`. The global `/webhook`, `/events`, `/api/sessions`, and
  `/sessions/...` endpoints return `404`. The hosted instance at
  `https://agstatus.online` runs in this mode.

`GET /api/config` tells you which mode a server is in.

## The session object

```json
{
  "id": "sess-abc",
  "name": "Refactor auth",
  "status": "coding",
  "message": "Editing server.ts",
  "project": "my-repo",
  "source": "claude",
  "host": {
    "machine": { "id": "9f2c1b7e4d3a8f0c5e6b2a1d9c8f7e6b", "name": "Mac" },
    "app": { "slug": "herdr", "name": "herdr", "kind": "multiplexer" }
  },
  "createdAt": 1752096000000,
  "updatedAt": 1752096030000,
  "tokens": 1284000
}
```

Timestamps are epoch milliseconds. `status` is one of `idle`, `planning`,
`coding`, `testing`, `blocked`, `done`
([what each one means](hooks.md#what-each-status-means)). Two of them the
server itself acts on: a transition into `blocked` — the agent has stopped and
needs a human — pushes every registered device, and a transition into `done` —
a turn finished and its answer is waiting to be read — pushes the devices that
asked for it (`notify_done`). The bundled hooks send `done` at the end of every
turn and `idle` only at `SessionStart`, so `idle` is close to unseen on a live
board and `done` is where a card rests between prompts. `host` says where the session runs
(see the [webhook table](#webhook-body-and-validation)); it is `null` for
the many sessions whose hook has not opted in, and the key is always present.

`tokens` is the lifetime token total this session's agent reports for it (see
[Per-session token totals](#per-session-token-totals)). Unlike `host` the key
is **absent**, not `null`, when the board holds no total — and absent means
*unknown*, never zero. It is not part of the webhook body: it arrives on its
own endpoint and is attached to the card on the way out, so a board that never
receives one emits exactly the session object it always did.

## Shared endpoints (both modes)

| Method & path     | Purpose |
| ----------------- | ------- |
| `GET /api/config` | `{mode: "legacy"\|"multi", version, statuses, push}`. Legacy mode adds `webhookUrl` and `requiresSecret`. `push` is `true` iff APNs is configured. |
| `GET /healthz`    | Liveness probe: `{ok: true, version}`. Legacy mode adds a `sessions` count. |
| `GET /`           | Dashboard UI shell (in multi-tenant mode the board itself is at `/w/<token>`). |

## Webhook body and validation

`POST /webhook` (legacy) and `POST /w/<token>/webhook` (multi-tenant) accept
the same JSON body and upsert a session by `session_id`:

| Field        | Type   | Required | Notes |
| ------------ | ------ | -------- | ----- |
| `session_id` | string | yes      | Unique session identifier. Must match `^[A-Za-z0-9._:-]{1,128}$`. |
| `status`     | enum   | yes      | One of `idle`, `planning`, `coding`, `testing`, `blocked`, `done`. |
| `name`       | string | no       | Human-readable title. Defaults to `session_id` if omitted (and never yet set — on update an omitted `name` carries the stored one forward). Truncated to 120 chars. The bundled Node hook sends a Claude Code session's own title when it has one (the Claude desktop app titles every session, `/rename` titles one in the CLI; never in minimal mode), otherwise the folder it pinned at `SessionStart` — the name a session is given there is the name it keeps, even if the session later changes directory — and the agent's name (`Claude`, `Codex`) for a session with no folder at all. It holds folder and title in a small local map and re-sends the name on every post rather than leaning on carry-forward; a folder pin on file wins over any later `SessionStart` for the same id, so `/compact`, `/clear` and `--resume` leave it alone, while a renamed session renames its card. See [Card names and projects](hooks.md#card-names-and-projects). |
| `message`    | string | no       | Short description of the current activity (shown on the card). Truncated to 300 chars. |
| `project`    | string | no       | Project or repo the session is working on. Truncated to 120 chars. Unlike `name`, the bundled hooks recompute it from the session's live working directory on every post, so after a `cd` the two legitimately disagree — the card keeps its original name while `project` follows the session. Per-project spend depends on that; see [Usage history and per-project spend](#usage-history-and-per-project-spend). The Node hook reports a working directory that is exactly a Claude worktree root, `<repo>/.claude/worktrees/<name>`, as `<repo>` — on the card only: the per-project usage rows still file that worktree's spend under its own folder. |
| `source`     | string | no       | Agent kind that owns the session, e.g. `claude` or `codex` (same regex as the usage `source`). Defaults to `claude`; omitted on update = carried forward. Dashboards use it to show only the limit bars of agents present on the board. |
| `host`       | object \| null | no | Where the session runs, sent by hooks that opted in to Focus: `{"machine": {"id", "name"}, "app": {"slug", "name", "kind"}}`. Omitted = carried forward; `null` = cleared (the hook opted out). `machine.id` must match `^[0-9a-f]{32}$` (a per-board hash, never a raw machine id) or the post is `400`. `machine.name` and `app.name` are trimmed and truncated to 32 chars; blank ones become `Machine` and the slug. `app.slug` is one of `agterm`, `iterm2`, `kitty`, `wezterm`, `terminal`, `ghostty`, `alacritty`, `warp`, `vscode`, `cursor`, `windsurf`, `jetbrains`, `zed`, `claude-desktop`, `codex-desktop`, `herdr`, `tmux`, `zellij`, `screen`, `windows-terminal`, `other` — anything else is stored as `other`; `app.kind` is one of `terminal`, `multiplexer`, `ide`, `desktop-app`, `unknown` — anything else becomes `unknown`. Every other key is dropped. |

Control characters are stripped from all string fields. Omitted optional
fields carry the previous value forward on update. The JSON body is capped at
16 KB. `host` is the one nullable field: it goes out as `null` on every
session that has none (REST and SSE alike), and it is scrubbed from the
stored row whenever a session is dismissed, evicted, expired or its
workspace deleted. It never appears in the session timeline or in push
notifications.

**Response** — `200 OK`:

```json
{ "ok": true, "session": { "id": "sess-abc", "status": "coding", ... } }
```

**Errors** — `400` on missing/malformed `session_id`, invalid `status`,
malformed `source`, or a `host` that is neither an object nor `null` or whose
`machine.id` fails the regex; `401` on bad secret (legacy mode with
`WEBHOOK_SECRET` set); `404` unknown
workspace (multi-tenant); `413` on bodies over 16 KB; `429` over the
per-workspace rate limit (multi-tenant).

## Plan usage

`POST /usage` (legacy, same secret rules as the webhook) and
`POST /w/<token>/usage` (multi-tenant) let a hook report how much of an
agent plan's rate limits is consumed, so dashboards can draw limit bars:

```json
{
  "source": "claude",
  "windows": [
    { "id": "session", "label": "Current session", "usedPct": 42, "resetsAt": 1752100000000 },
    { "id": "week", "label": "Weekly (all models)", "usedPct": 61.5, "resetsAt": 1752300000000 }
  ]
}
```

| Field      | Type   | Required | Notes |
| ---------- | ------ | -------- | ----- |
| `source`   | string | yes      | Agent kind, e.g. `claude` or `codex`. Must match `^[a-z][a-z0-9_-]{0,23}$`. |
| `windows`  | array  | yes      | 1–6 windows with unique `id`s (`^[a-z][a-z0-9_-]{0,31}$`). |
| `usedPct`  | number | yes      | Percent of the limit consumed. Clamped to 0–100. |
| `label`    | string | no       | Display name; defaults to `id`. Truncated to 48 chars. |
| `resetsAt` | number | no       | Epoch ms when the window resets; anything invalid becomes `null`. |

A report is stored per workspace, per `source`, per window id — **never per
session.** A plan limit is account-wide, so every session of an agent reports
the same numbers into the same set of windows and the newest report wins; the
bars do not belong to a card, and dismissing a card does not clear them. The
window id `session` is the plan's own name for its 5-hour rolling window (the
bundled hooks label it "Current session"), not the agent session in front of
you: it keeps counting across restarts and does not reset when a session ends.

The server keeps the latest report per `source` (a re-post replaces the
previous one), broadcasts the full usage list as an SSE `usage` event, and
answers `{ok: true}`. Usage posts share the webhook rate-limit budget.
Reports older than 24 hours are dropped from reads — stale percentages
mislead.

**At most 8 sources per workspace**, counted across `/usage`,
`/usage/projects` and `/usage/sessions` together. A report from a ninth source
gets `429 {"error": "too many usage sources for this workspace (at most 8)"}`;
the sources already held keep reporting on every endpoint. The bundled hooks
use two (`claude`, `codex`). A malformed report never takes a slot.

`GET /api/usage` (legacy) and `GET /w/<token>/api/usage` return the
current list:

```json
[ { "source": "claude", "windows": [ ... ], "updatedAt": 1752096030000 } ]
```

## Usage history and per-project spend

Two series back the usage detail screen, and they are **different measures**.

**The limit over time.** Every report is kept, not just the newest, but only
when a window's `usedPct` actually moved — a plan limit is a step function and
reports arrive far more often than it changes — and at most one point per
window per minute: a reading less than a minute after the last recorded one
still moves the live bar but is not added to the history (the charts sample
once a day, and each hook reports at most every five minutes). A workspace keeps
history for at most 48 (source, window) series; past that a new window id
still shows as a bar but keeps no history, and a series silent for 90 days
gives its slot back. Nothing is retroactive: a board has limit history from
the moment it first receives a report.

**Where the tokens went.** Neither agent's usage API says which project spent
the quota, so the hook derives it from the logs each agent already writes
locally and reports daily totals with `POST /usage/projects` (legacy, same
secret rules as the webhook) or `POST /w/<token>/usage/projects`:

```json
{
  "source": "claude",
  "days": [
    { "project": "jobsearch", "day": "2026-09-07", "tokens": 87600000 },
    { "project": "claude-status", "day": "2026-09-07", "tokens": 18700000 }
  ]
}
```

| Field     | Type   | Required | Notes |
| --------- | ------ | -------- | ----- |
| `source`  | string | yes      | Agent kind, same rule as plan usage. |
| `days`    | array  | yes      | 1–200 rows. The cap keeps a report inside the 16kb body limit; a longer backfill sends several. |
| `project` | string | yes      | Project folder name, truncated to 120 chars. |
| `day`     | string | yes      | `YYYY-MM-DD`, UTC. A row whose day does not exist (`2026-02-30`, `9999-99-99`) or falls outside the last 90 days through tomorrow is dropped, not rejected — see below. |
| `tokens`  | number | yes      | Tokens spent that day. Clamped to ≥ 0 and floored; above `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` the report is a `400`. |

A day is **replaced**, not accumulated, so re-running a backfill converges
instead of double-counting. Reported tokens are input + output + cache
creation; cache reads are excluded because they are ~94% of raw token volume
but a small share of what a plan limit charges.

**Not every well-formed row is kept**, and the response says what became of
them: `{"ok": true, "days": N, "dropped": D, "refused": R}`. `days` rows were
stored. `dropped` rows named a day that does not exist or lies outside the
retained window — today minus 90 days through tomorrow (UTC) — and are
skipped silently rather than failing the report, because a backfill
legitimately sends everything the local logs still hold. `refused` rows were
new (source, project, day) keys arriving when the workspace already holds
5,000; a row for a key it already holds is always stored. Days that age out of
the window leave the board (flagged on disk, never deleted) and free their
slots. A malformed row — a bad shape, a missing field — still fails the whole
report with `400`.

**A row is a folder and a day, not a session.** There is no session id and no
card name in this series: every session that spent tokens in a folder on a day
is summed into the same row. So one row can be several sessions' work, and a
session that moves between projects contributes to two rows, split at the point
it moved — even though its card keeps its name through the move
(see [the webhook `name` field](#webhook-body-and-validation)). The two series
answer different questions: a card says which session this is, these rows say
where the quota went. How fine the split can be depends on the agent's own
logs: Claude Code stamps every request with the directory it ran in, so a
Claude session that moves is split at the moment it moved, while a Codex
rollout names its directory once at the top of the file, so a Codex session
that moves keeps all of its spend under the folder it started in.

`GET /api/usage/history` and `GET /w/<token>/api/usage/history` return both
series. `?days=N` selects the range (default 30, capped at 90). Reads have a
budget of their own, 30 a minute per workspace (`429 {"error": "rate limit
exceeded"}` beyond), separate from the webhook's:

```json
{
  "days": 30,
  "history": [
    { "source": "claude", "windowId": "week",
      "points": [ { "at": 1752096030000, "usedPct": 54 } ] }
  ],
  "projects": [
    { "source": "claude", "project": "jobsearch", "day": "2026-09-07", "tokens": 87600000 }
  ]
}
```

Each series keeps the last reading from *before* the requested range as its
first point, so a step chart has a value to start from. Both are retained for
90 days.

## Per-session token totals

The same pass over the same local logs that produces the project-day rows also
keys them by session id — Claude stamps every assistant record with the session
that produced it, and a Codex rollout is named after its session. The hook
reports those totals with `POST /usage/sessions` (legacy, same secret rules as
the webhook) or `POST /w/<token>/usage/sessions`:

```json
{
  "source": "claude",
  "sessions": [
    { "session_id": "019a7f3c-8b21-7c4e-9d6f-2b6e4a1c77d0", "tokens": 1284000 },
    { "session_id": "019a7f3c-9c02-7a55-b1e4-8d3f0c2a91b7", "tokens": 96500 }
  ]
}
```

| Field        | Type   | Required | Notes |
| ------------ | ------ | -------- | ----- |
| `source`     | string | yes      | Agent kind, same rule as plan usage. Part of the key: the two agents mint session ids independently. |
| `sessions`   | array  | yes      | 1–100 rows. The cap keeps a report inside the 16 KB body limit; a longer run sends several. |
| `session_id` | string | yes      | Must match `^[A-Za-z0-9._:-]{1,64}$` — the webhook's charset, held to half its length (both agents use a uuid). The same id the webhook posts, so a row joins straight onto the card. |
| `tokens`     | number | yes      | The session's **absolute lifetime total**, never a delta. Clamped to ≥ 0 and floored. |

A row is stored under (workspace, `source`, `session_id`) and **replaces** the
value held, so a re-post is harmless and a post that never lands costs only
freshness. It may legitimately move **down**: the hook's counter restarts when
its state file is lost with the log already pruned, or when a session was
evicted by the hook's own 400-entry cap and later resumed. The server stores
what it is sent — it does not take the larger of the two, and a decrease is not
an error. A duplicated `session_id` inside one body is not rejected either: the
last one wins. A total for a session that has no card is accepted and kept, so
a session that comes back finds its number waiting. Session-total posts share
the webhook rate-limit budget. The response is
`{"ok": true, "sessions": N, "refused": R}`: `N` rows stored after duplicates
collapse, and `R` new session ids the board had no room for. A workspace holds
at most 500 totals; past that a new `(source, session_id)` is refused unless
that session has a card on the board right now, while a total it already holds
is always updated. Totals past their 7-day retention free their slots.

**Where it shows up.** There is no read endpoint: the number is served as the
`tokens` field of [the session object](#the-session-object), which the
`snapshot` and `session` SSE events already carry, so a card gets its total the
same way it gets every other change. When a report moves a number, every card
it belongs to is rebroadcast as a `session` event; a report that repeats itself
broadcasts nothing.

**What the number is, and what it is not.** It is the tokens *this session*
spent, summed across days and — for Claude — across every folder it worked in.
It is **not** a plan-limit percentage and does not convert into one: a limit
window says how much of an account-wide allowance is gone
(see [Plan usage](#plan-usage)), while this counts tokens, and nothing here
supplies a denominator. It is also **not** a slice of the per-project series:
a project-day row sums across sessions, this sums across days, and adding the
two together means nothing. Finally, the two agents count differently — Claude's
figure is input + output + cache creation, Codex's is its own cumulative
`total_token_usage`, which includes cache reads — so a Claude card's number and
a Codex card's number are each exact about their own agent and are not
comparable with each other. Anything showing them side by side should say whose
they are rather than imply a shared scale.

**Retention.** A total is kept for **7 days** after the report that set it,
on the server's own received-at clock — not the day-keyed retention the project
rows use, and not the card's 24 hours. The hook reports on a 15-minute throttle
and only for sessions whose number moved, so a session resumed after a weekend
gets its card back from the first webhook but its total only from the next
usage run; the stored value carries the card in between. Older totals are
dropped from reads and from memory, and a workspace holds at most 500 (past
that, a new session id is refused unless its session has a card on the board;
see above). Deleting a workspace removes its totals with everything else.

## Session history

`GET /api/sessions/:id/history` (legacy) and
`GET /w/<token>/api/sessions/:id/history` return a session's timeline —
one entry per status/message transition, newest first (identical
keep-alive re-posts are not recorded):

```json
[
  { "seq": 2, "status": "testing", "message": "npm test", "at": 1752096030000 },
  { "seq": 1, "status": "coding", "message": "Editing server.ts", "at": 1752096010000 },
  { "seq": 0, "status": "idle", "message": "Session started", "at": 1752096000000 }
]
```

`seq` increases monotonically per session and is a stable identity for
clients. It is not dense and does not start at 0 for each session — the server
numbers every session's events from one counter, so the values a session sees
have gaps — and nothing should be read into its size. The last 100 entries
are kept per session (older ones are
soft-deleted); dismissing or expiring a session drops its history. Unknown
sessions return `[]`.

## Focus commands

Focus lets a tap on a card bring the session's terminal to the front on the
machine running it (design: [docs/design/focus-protocol.md](design/focus-protocol.md)).
Three parties take part: a **viewer** (the phone or web board), the
**server**, and a **listener** — the AgStatus process on each machine that
opted in. A session can be focused only when its `host` is set and that
machine's listener is online.

```
viewer   ─▶ POST …/commands {id, type, session_id}      server attaches machine_id from session.host
server   ─▶ SSE `command` ─▶ listener                     only the listener for that machine
listener ─▶ POST …/commands/:id/claim                    exactly-once, then acts locally
listener ─▶ POST …/commands/:id/ack {result, reach, reason}
server   ─▶ SSE `command_ack` ─▶ everyone                 or {result: "failed", reason: "expired"} at the TTL
viewer   ─▶ GET …/commands/:id                           polling, for a phone that backgrounded
```

Commands carry **ids only** — never a path, a binary or an argument — and
live **in memory only**, like pairing codes: a restart drops them, and the
phone simply sees its command time out. The paths below are shown for
multi-tenant mode; legacy mode mounts the same handlers at the root
(`POST /commands`, `POST /commands/:id/claim`, …) with the `POST`s behind
`X-Webhook-Secret` when `WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set, like the webhook.

### Listener presence

A listener subscribes to the ordinary event stream with a `listener` query
parameter, and proves it is that machine with an `Authorization: Bearer` header:

```
GET /w/<token>/events?listener=<machine_id>&name=<label>
Authorization: Bearer <machine_key>
```

| Field                    | Rule |
| ------------------------ | ---- |
| `?listener=`             | Required. The machine id the hook reports in `host.machine.id`; must match `^[0-9a-f]{32}$` (`400` otherwise). Public — every viewer reads it off the `machines` frame — so it is a routing label, not a credential, and it stays in the URL. |
| `Authorization: Bearer <key>` | Required. The **machine key**: 64 lowercase hex, the value the id is derived from (`machine_id = sha256(key)[0..32]`, see the [design](design/focus-protocol.md#32-wire-summary--the-host-webhook-field)). `400` when malformed; `403 {"error": "wrong_key"}` when it does not hash to `?listener=`. Only the machine holds the key — every viewer sees the id in the snapshot, so the id alone proves nothing, and a viewer can neither take a machine's slot nor end its stream. A header, not a query parameter, because nginx, Cloudflare and most PaaS record `$request_uri` verbatim: a key in the URL lands in access logs, which are shipped to aggregators and shared far more widely than the board token. And `Authorization` rather than a name of our own, because log pipelines that redact credentials match on the header name — Caddy's `log_credentials` covers exactly Cookie, Set-Cookie, Authorization and Proxy-Authorization, so a custom name would be logged in full. |
| `?name=`                 | Label shown on the board; control characters stripped, trimmed, truncated to 32 chars; blank → `Machine`. Nothing else from the query reaches the board. |

**`?key=` is refused.** Any `GET /events` carrying a `key` query parameter —
listener or plain viewer — answers `400` and opens no stream, so a client
still on the old shape cannot appear connected while unauthenticated. The
rejection never echoes the value; a key that reached a URL is in an access
log already and should be rotated.

Listener slots are separate from the 10 viewer slots: at most **5 listeners
per workspace** (`429 {"error": "too many listeners"}` for a 6th machine),
one per `machine_id` — a new connection for a machine that is already
connected replaces the old stream (the old one is ended without an
`offline` event). Connects are limited to **30/min per workspace**
(`429 {"error": "rate limit exceeded"}`; the listener should sleep 60 s),
since every one is broadcast to every viewer. On connect the listener
receives `snapshot`, then a `commands` frame with the unclaimed commands
waiting for that machine, and every viewer (and listener) receives
`machine {online: true}`. When the stream closes everyone receives
`machine {online: false}`. After that the listener gets every event a viewer
gets, plus `command` frames addressed to its machine, and the same 25 s
keepalive.

`GET /w/<token>/api/machines` (legacy: `GET /api/machines`) returns the
machines currently online, the same array a viewer gets in its `machines`
frame — id, label, and since when; no platform or version:

```json
[ { "id": "9f2c…", "name": "MacBook", "online": true, "since": 1752096000000 } ]
```

### Command endpoints

| Method & path                          | Purpose |
| -------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `POST /w/<token>/commands`             | Send a command. Body `{"id": "<client uuid>", "type": "focus"\|"resume", "session_id": "<id>"}`. `id` is a UUID the client mints (normalized to lowercase) so a retry can be told from a second tap. `200 {id, delivered, expires_in_ms}` — `delivered` is whether a listener for the session's machine is connected right now. |
| `POST /w/<token>/commands/:id/claim`   | Listener only. Body `{"machine_key": "<64 hex>"}` — the key of the machine the command was routed to (see [presence](#listener-presence)). Moves `pending → claimed`; a second claim fails, so execution is exactly-once across a LaunchAgent and a stray manual run. `200 {ok: true, expires_in_ms}`. Nothing is broadcast. |
| `POST /w/<token>/commands/:id/ack`     | Listener only. Body `{"machine_key", "result", "reach"?, "reason"?}` — **enums only, no other keys** (see below). Moves `claimed → done`, answers `200 {ok: true}` and broadcasts `command_ack`. |
| `GET /w/<token>/commands/:id`          | `200 {id, type, session_id, machine_id, state, result, reach, reason, created_at, expires_at, claimed_at, done_at}` (unset values are `null`); `404` when unknown or already swept. |

**Status codes.** `POST /commands`: `400` on a malformed `id`, `type` or
`session_id`; `404 {"error": "unknown_session"}`; `409 {"error": "no_host"}`
when the session's hook has not opted in to Focus; `409 {"error": "duplicate_id"}`;
`429 {"error": "rate limit exceeded"}` past 10 commands/min per workspace;
`429 {"error": "too_many_pending"}` at 10 pending commands per workspace (a
re-tap on a card that is already waiting replaces its predecessor and is not
counted). `claim`: `400` bad `machine_key`; `404 {"error": "not_found"}`;
`403 {"error": "wrong_machine"}` when `machine_key` is not the key of the
machine the command was routed to — the public `machine_id` is no
credential; `409 {"error": "already_claimed"}` unless the command is pending;
`410 {"error": "expired"}`. `ack`: `400` on an unknown body key, a bad
`machine_key`, a value outside its enum, or `result: "failed"` without a
`reason`; `404`/`403` as for claim; `409 {"error": "not_claimed"}` while
still pending; `409 {"error": "already_done"}`; `410 {"error": "expired"}`.

**Enums.** `type` ∈ `focus | resume`. `result` ∈
`focused | activated | selected | resumed | failed`. `reach` (how far the
listener got) ∈ `pane | tab | window | app | thread`. `reason` (required when
`result` is `failed`) ∈ `no-record | remote | not-running | app-not-running |
consent-needed | mux-detached | ambiguous | unsupported-host | bad-record |
respawn-failed | unsupported-type | superseded | expired`. There is no free
text anywhere on this channel: a message field would put the machine's cwd,
tty or stderr in front of every board viewer.

**Lifecycle.** `pending → claimed → done`, or `→ expired` from either live
state once `COMMAND_TTL_MS` (default 120000, 2 minutes; whole milliseconds,
at least 1000) has passed — the server then broadcasts
`command_ack {result: "failed", reason: "expired"}` so every command
terminates observably. A session that leaves the board (dismissed, cleared,
evicted or expired) takes its pending commands with it: each is finished as
`failed / superseded` and its `command_ack` follows the `remove` (or
`snapshot`) event, so the listener never raises a window for a card nobody
is looking at; a claimed one is left to ack or expire. The `machine_id` always comes from
`session.host` on the server; a client cannot aim a command at a machine of
its choosing. A second command for the same `(session_id, type, machine_id)`
while the first is still pending **supersedes** it: the older one is
finished as `failed / superseded` (its `command_ack` is broadcast) and the
new one goes out. Done and expired commands stay readable through `GET` for
10 minutes, then are forgotten.

## Legacy (single-tenant) endpoints

| Method & path          | Purpose                                        | Auth |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---- |
| `POST /webhook`        | Create/update a session (see above; `host` included). | yes* |
| `POST /usage`          | Report plan usage (see [Plan usage](#plan-usage)). | yes* |
| `POST /usage/projects` | Report per-project token spend (see [Usage history](#usage-history-and-per-project-spend)). | yes* |
| `POST /usage/sessions` | Report per-session token totals (see [Per-session token totals](#per-session-token-totals)). | yes* |
| `GET /events`          | SSE stream (see [format](#sse-event-format)); `?listener=` plus `Authorization: Bearer` subscribes a Focus listener (see [presence](#listener-presence)). | no; yes* with `?listener=` |
| `GET /api/sessions`    | JSON list of all sessions.                     | no   |
| `GET /api/machines`    | Focus listeners currently online.              | no   |
| `POST /commands`       | Send a Focus command (see [Focus commands](#focus-commands)). | yes* |
| `POST /commands/:id/claim` | Listener claims a command.                 | yes* |
| `POST /commands/:id/ack` | Listener reports the outcome.                | yes* |
| `GET /commands/:id`    | Command state, for polling.                    | no   |
| `GET /api/usage`       | Current plan usage list.                       | no   |
| `GET /api/usage/history` | Limit history + per-project spend.           | no   |
| `GET /api/sessions/:id/history` | Session timeline (see [Session history](#session-history)). | no |
| `DELETE /sessions/:id` | Remove one session. Returns `{ok: boolean}`.   | no   |
| `POST /sessions/clear` | Remove all sessions. Returns `{ok: true}`.     | yes* |

\* Only when `WEBHOOK_SECRET` is configured: send `X-Webhook-Secret: <value>`,
else `401`. Reads and `DELETE /sessions/:id` stay open so the dashboard can
list and dismiss cards. Focus is otherwise identical in legacy mode.

## Multi-tenant: workspace endpoints

There are no accounts — a workspace is identified by an unguessable token
embedded in its URLs (`ags_` + 32 URL-safe characters). Anyone who has the
URL can view and update that workspace; treat it like a secret. The server
stores only a SHA-256 hash of the token; the raw token is returned exactly
once, at creation.

### Create a workspace

```bash
curl -X POST https://agstatus.online/api/workspaces
```

**Response** — `201 Created`:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "token": "ags_...",
  "dashboardUrl": "https://.../w/ags_...",
  "webhookUrl": "https://.../w/ags_.../webhook"
}
```

Save the token — it is not shown again. Creation is rate limited to 20 per
hour per IP (`429` beyond) and returns `503` at the `MAX_WORKSPACES` cap.

### Workspace-scoped endpoints

Everything under `/w/<token>/...` mirrors the legacy API, scoped to one
workspace:

| Method & path                    | Purpose |
| -------------------------------- | ------- |
| `GET /w/<token>`                 | Dashboard UI for this workspace. |
| `GET /w/<token>/api/sessions`    | JSON list of the workspace's sessions (newest first). |
| `GET /w/<token>/events`          | SSE stream (see [format](#sse-event-format)). `429` past 10 concurrent connections. `?listener=<machine_id>` with an `Authorization: Bearer` header subscribes a Focus listener instead, in its own slot budget (see [presence](#listener-presence)). |
| `POST /w/<token>/webhook`        | Create/update a session (same body as legacy, `host` included). `200` with `{ok, session}`; `400` on validation errors; `429` over the rate limit. |
| `POST /w/<token>/usage`          | Report plan usage (see [Plan usage](#plan-usage)). |
| `POST /w/<token>/usage/projects` | Report per-project token spend (see [Usage history](#usage-history-and-per-project-spend)). |
| `POST /w/<token>/usage/sessions` | Report per-session token totals (see [Per-session token totals](#per-session-token-totals)). |
| `GET /w/<token>/api/usage`       | Current plan usage list. |
| `GET /w/<token>/api/usage/history` | Limit history + per-project spend. `?days=N` (default 30, max 90). |
| `GET /w/<token>/api/sessions/:id/history` | Session timeline (see [Session history](#session-history)). |
| `GET /w/<token>/api/machines`    | Focus listeners currently online (see [presence](#listener-presence)). |
| `POST /w/<token>/commands`       | Send a Focus command (see [Focus commands](#focus-commands)). |
| `POST /w/<token>/commands/:id/claim` | Listener claims a command. |
| `POST /w/<token>/commands/:id/ack` | Listener reports the outcome. |
| `GET /w/<token>/commands/:id`    | Command state, for polling. |
| `DELETE /w/<token>/sessions/:id` | Remove one session. Returns `{ok: boolean}`. |
| `POST /w/<token>/sessions/clear` | Remove all sessions in the workspace. Returns `{ok: true}`. |
| `DELETE /w/<token>`              | Delete the whole workspace: all sessions, device registrations and pending commands removed, event and listener streams closed. Returns `{ok: true}`. |

Any request with an invalid or unknown token returns
`404 {"error": "unknown workspace"}`. All `/w/...` routes send permissive
CORS headers (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`; methods
`GET,POST,DELETE,OPTIONS`; `OPTIONS` answers `204`) — the token in the path
is the credential, so origins add nothing.

### Pairing endpoints

Pairing lets a device that owns a workspace (e.g. the iOS app) hand it to
another machine (the CLI) via a short, typeable code. Codes are 8 characters
from an ambiguity-free alphabet (no `I`/`L`/`O`/`0`/`1`), displayed grouped
as `XXXX-XXXX`, single-use, held in memory only, and expire after 15 minutes.

| Method & path          | Purpose |
| ---------------------- | ------- |
| `POST /w/<token>/pair` | Create a pairing code for this workspace. `201` with `{ok: true, code: "XXXX-XXXX", expiresInSeconds: 900}`. Max 3 outstanding codes per workspace (`429` beyond); creating a new code does not invalidate the others. |
| `POST /api/pair/claim` | Body `{"code": "XXXX-XXXX"}` (case, dashes, and whitespace are normalized away). `200` with the same `{ok, token, dashboardUrl, webhookUrl}` shape as workspace creation; the code is consumed. `400` on a missing/non-string code; `404` on unknown/expired/already-used codes. Rate limited to 10 attempts per minute per IP (`429`). |

### Device (push) endpoints

Multi-tenant mode only. Devices register per workspace to receive APNs
notifications; see [docs/self-hosting.md](self-hosting.md#push-notifications-apns)
for the server-side setup and trigger rules.

| Method & path                            | Purpose |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `POST /w/<token>/devices`                | Register/update a device. Body: `{"device_token": "<hex>", "platform": "ios", "notify_done": false}`. `device_token` must match `^[0-9a-fA-F]{16,200}$` and `platform` must be `"ios"` (`400` otherwise). Upserts by (workspace, token) — re-POST updates `notify_done`. Max 10 devices per workspace: `429` for a new device past the cap; updates to existing devices always succeed. A workspace may also register at most 100 distinct device tokens over its lifetime, unregistered ones included (an unregistered device's row is kept, flagged): `429 {"error": "too many device tokens have been registered to this workspace"}` for a token past that, while a token it has had before can always come back. Returns `{ok: true}`. Registering and unregistering share a budget of 10 a minute per workspace (`429 {"error": "rate limit exceeded"}`). |
| `DELETE /w/<token>/devices/:deviceToken` | Unregister. Returns `{ok: boolean}`. Shares the device budget above. |

Deleting the workspace purges its device registrations. Tokens Apple reports
as expired or unregistered are pruned automatically.

## SSE event format

`GET /events` (legacy) and `GET /w/<token>/events` (multi-tenant) are
standard `text/event-stream` responses:

```
event: snapshot
data: [ { ...session }, ... ]

event: session
data: { ...session }

event: remove
data: { "id": "sess-abc" }

event: usage
data: [ { "source": "claude", "windows": [ ... ], "updatedAt": 1752096030000 } ]

event: machines
data: [ { "id": "9f2c…", "name": "MacBook", "online": true, "since": 1752096000000 } ]

event: machine
data: { "id": "9f2c…", "name": "MacBook", "online": true, "since": 1752096000000 }

event: machine
data: { "id": "9f2c…", "online": false, "lastSeen": 1752096900000 }

event: commands
data: [ { "id": "6c1f…", "type": "focus", "session_id": "sess-abc", "machine_id": "9f2c…", "expires_in_ms": 98000 } ]

event: command
data: { "id": "6c1f…", "type": "focus", "session_id": "sess-abc", "machine_id": "9f2c…", "expires_in_ms": 120000 }

event: command_ack
data: { "id": "6c1f…", "session_id": "sess-abc", "machine_id": "9f2c…", "type": "focus", "result": "focused", "reach": "tab", "reason": null }

: keepalive
```

- `snapshot` — the full session list. Sent once on connect and again (empty)
  after `sessions/clear` or workspace deletion.
- `session` — a session was created or updated.
- `remove` — a session was deleted, evicted, or expired.
- `usage` — the full plan-usage list (see [Plan usage](#plan-usage)). Sent
  on connect when non-empty, and after every usage report.
- `machines` — every Focus listener currently online. Sent to viewers once,
  right after `snapshot` (an empty array when none is connected).
- `machine` — a listener came online (`{id, name, online: true, since}`) or
  went away (`{id, online: false, lastSeen}`). Sent to everyone.
- `commands` — the unclaimed commands waiting for a listener's machine. Sent
  to that listener once, right after its `snapshot`.
- `command` — a new command for the listener's machine. Sent **only** to
  that listener; viewers never see it.
- `command_ack` — a command finished: the listener acked it, a re-tap or the
  session's removal superseded it, or it expired
  (`{result: "failed", reason: "expired"}`). Sent to everyone. See
  [Focus commands](#focus-commands).
- A `: keepalive` comment line is sent every 25 s, on listener streams too.

The server sets `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-transform` and
`X-Accel-Buffering: no` so reverse proxies don't buffer the stream. When a
workspace is deleted, its open streams receive a final empty `snapshot` and
are closed.

## Limits

To keep a shared instance healthy, multi-tenant workspaces are capped:

| Limit | Value | Behavior at the limit |
| ----- | ----- | --------------------- |
| Sessions per workspace | 50 | A new session evicts the oldest-updated one (a `remove` event is broadcast for it). |
| Concurrent SSE connections per workspace | 10 | The 11th gets `429` before the stream starts. |
| Webhook requests per workspace | 120/min | `429`. |
| Devices per workspace | 10 | `429` for new devices. |
| Device tokens per workspace, ever | 100 (unregistered ones included) | `429` for a token the workspace has never had; a returning one is fine. |
| Device registrations + removals per workspace | 10/min | `429`. |
| Usage-history reads per workspace | 30/min | `429` (its own budget, separate from the webhook's). |
| Outstanding pairing codes per workspace | 3 | `429`. |
| Focus commands per workspace | 10/min | `429` (its own budget, separate from the webhook's). |
| Pending Focus commands per workspace | 10 | `429 {"error": "too_many_pending"}`. |
| Focus listeners per workspace | 5 (one per machine) | `429` for a 6th machine; a reconnect replaces the machine's old stream. |
| Focus listener connects per workspace | 30/min | `429`; the listener sleeps 60 s. |
| Focus command TTL | 2 min (`COMMAND_TTL_MS`) | Unclaimed or unacked commands fail as `expired` (a `command_ack` is broadcast); finished ones are forgotten 10 min later. Commands are in memory only — a restart drops them. |
| Workspace creations | 20/hour/IP | `429`. |
| Pair-code claims | 10/min/IP | `429`. |
| Session TTL | 24 h (`SESSION_TTL_MS`) | Expired sessions are swept and `remove` events broadcast. |
| Idle workspaces | 60 days | Deleted by a periodic sweep (every 6 hours). |
| Live workspaces | `MAX_WORKSPACES` (default 10000) | Creation returns `503`. |
| Rows per project-day report | 200 | `400`; the hook sends several reports. |
| Project days per workspace | 5,000 (source, project, day) keys | New keys are refused and counted in the response's `refused`; held keys still update. |
| Project-day window | today − 90 days … tomorrow (UTC), real dates only | Other rows are dropped and counted in `dropped`; aged-out days are flagged and free their slots. |
| Usage sources per workspace | 8, across `/usage`, `/usage/projects` and `/usage/sessions` | `429` for a new source. |
| Limit-history series per workspace | 48 (source, window) pairs | A new window shows as a bar but keeps no history. |
| Limit-history points | 1 per series per minute | The reading moves the bar; no history point is added. |
| Rows per session-total report | 100 | `400`; the hook chunks at the same number. |
| Per-session totals per workspace | 500 | New session ids are refused (counted in `refused`) unless the session has a card on the board; held ones still update. |
| Per-session total retention | 7 days | Dropped from reads and from memory; see [Per-session token totals](#per-session-token-totals). |
| Request body | 16 KB | `413`. |

In both modes: `name`/`project` truncate to 120 chars, `message` to 300,
`host.machine.name`/`host.app.name` to 32; control characters are stripped.
Push alerts per (session, kind) are debounced to one per minute.
