/**
 * The AgStatus design system, third client.
 *
 * The web is the source (public/tokens.css, in OKLCH) and iOS converted it
 * once (ios/AgStatus/Theme.swift), keeping every OKLCH original written beside
 * its concrete value. This is a TRANSCRIPTION of that table, not a second
 * conversion: the three clients must agree to the byte, and re-deriving the
 * maths here would be a third chance to disagree.
 *
 * What this replaces: `#0B0D12` with six unmodified Tailwind defaults on it
 * (blue-500 planning, purple-500 coding, amber-500 testing, red-500 blocked,
 * emerald-500 done). That is the "generic AI dashboard" the project brief
 * names as its first anti-reference, and it is what v1.5.0's own release notes
 * meant by "Android still has the old palette".
 *
 * WHY WARM. Every neutral is tinted toward hue 155 at very low chroma —
 * imperceptible as colour, but it stops the ground reading as cold blue-black.
 *
 * COLOUR IS RANKED BY WHO IS WAITING, not by lifecycle stage. `done` and
 * `blocked` are the two states that need a human, so they carry the chroma;
 * planning, coding and testing recede. Ranking by stage put the brightest
 * colour on `coding` — the most common state — and the dimmest on the ones
 * that actually need you.
